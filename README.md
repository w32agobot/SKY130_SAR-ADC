# Abstract
 The proposed design is a versatile non-binary, asynchronous (= self clocked) 12 bit SAR-ADC (successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter), using a segmented 12 bit capacitive DAC with 9 bit thermometer-coded capacitor array and 3 bit binary capacitor cells. The SAR-ADC Layout has previously been added to the [IIC Mixed-Signal Circuits Submission](https://github.com/iic-jku/mpw8-submission) for the Open MPW-8 Shuttle.

## Key Features 
* Differential analog inputs.
* ADC physical resolution of 12 bit, up to 16 bit with oversampling.
* Sample rate configurable in a broad range from 28S/s (low-power biosensor applications) up to 1.2MS/s. 
* Non-binary SAR weights for error correction capability.
* Oversampling FIR boxcar filter with 1/4/16/64/256 samples to increase the resolution.
* Averaging of 4 least significant SAR weights with 1/3/7/15/31 samples to reduce the impact of comparator noise.
* Clock generator with a configurable frequency. The clock generator layout has been hardened with `OpenLane` using a gate level description of the clock loop. The delay elements in the loop use a custom high-delay standard cell `sky130_mm_sc__hd_dlyPoly5ns` which fits into the `sky130_fd_sc__hd_` standard cell grid.
* Integrated switched capacitor voltage generator for the common mode reference voltage.
* 12 bit capacitor DAC:
  * Unit capacitor with $C^{1}$=0.447 fF.
  * 3 bit binary-coded cells with 1x1, 1x2 and 1x4 unit capacitors $C^{1}$ + $C^{2}$ + $C^{4}$ for LSB bits.
  * 9 bit thermometer-coded cells with 1x8 unit capacitors $C^{8}_{1..511}$=3.58 fF.
  * The total capacitance per DAC matric is 1.83 pF.
* The thermometer-code row/column decoder can be switched from a sequential to a symmetrical mode to decrease the integral nonlinearity error.
* Total area of $442 \mu m \cdot 402\mu m = 178.000 \mu m^2$, the area decreases to $124.000 \mu m^2$ if the $V_\mathrm{CM}$ voltage generator is not included.

# Performance characteristics
Characterization of the ADC has been done through post-layout simulation with parasitic C extraction. For the typical setting, the SAR-ADC has been configured to use 3 samples per LSB averaging, 4 samples oversampling, and a symmetric thermometer-code sequence. The clock generator has been set to use the lowest delay configurations (`00001`), as a result, the ADC is sampling at 824 kS/s with a Nyquist bandwidth of 103 kHz. The waveforms obtained in the simulation can be seen in Fig. 3, and the results are summarized in Table 1.

# Top-Level Interface
The configuration bytes `config_1_in` and `config_2_in` are used to activate the sequential/symmetrical row/column decoder modes and to configure the delays in the self-clocked loop. The configuration port mapping is described in [doc/interface.md](doc/Interface.md). `rst_n` will reset the circuit active-low. After reset de-assertion the circuit waits for the trigger signal `start_conversion_in`, an edge-detection-circuit ensures that only one conversion is triggered if the start signal stays high. A single conversion is done when `conversion_finished_out` changes to `HIGH`, additionally, `conversion_finished_osr_out` signalizes a finished OSR sequence and an update of the result at the output. Input signal `clk_vcm` is the clock signal for the switched-capacitor voltage generator, it is designed for a low frequency of 32.768 kHz.
